# ProcessEight_AddCustomerEavAttributeExample

## Purpose
A module to demonstrate how to add new EAV attributes to the Customer entity.

Tested on Magento Open Source 2.2.5.

## Customising the 'Customer' entity

### Add a new EAV attribute

The only required attribute property for a Customer attribute is `attribute_code`. 

Any property not explicitly set will be automatically set to a default value before it is created.

Customer attributes do not need to be added to forms. Adding an attribute to a form is only necessary if it needs to be visible/editable in the admin or on the frontend.

#### Through the admin

It is not possible to edit Customer entity attributes through the admin in Magento Open Source edition.
