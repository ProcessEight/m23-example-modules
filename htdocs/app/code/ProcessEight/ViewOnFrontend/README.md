# ProcessEight_ViewOnFrontend

## Purpose
Adds a button to the edit product form in the admin which will open the product in the default store view, in a new tab.

This implementation is designed to be just 'good enough' so it doesn't check to whether the product is enabled or visible, for example.

Tested on Magento Open Source 2.3.1.
